        <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Converting information into a form that can be stored</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Maintaining information over time</li>
        <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> Accessing stored information when needed</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Types of Memory</h3>
      <p>Understanding different types of memory helps clarify what can be enhanced:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensory Memory:</strong> Brief retention of sensory information</li>
        <li><strong>Short-term Memory:</strong> Temporary storage of limited information</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term Memory:</strong> Permanent storage of unlimited information</li>
        <li><strong>Working Memory:</strong> Active manipulation of information</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>What Memory Enhancement Can Achieve</h2>
      
      <h3>Realistic Improvements</h3>
      <p>While true photographic memory may be rare, memory training can lead to remarkable improvements:</p>
      
      <ul>
